CORS, which stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a security feature 
implemented by web browsers. It is a set of rules that determine how a web page
 in one domain can request and interact with resources from another domain. CORS 
 is designed to prevent malicious websites from making unauthorized requests to
  a different domain, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

When a web page makes a cross-origin HTTP request (i.e., a request to a different
 domain, protocol, or port), the browser enforces the Same-Origin Policy, which 
 typically restricts such requests for security reasons. CORS provides a way for
  servers to declare which origins are permitted to access their resources.

Here's a brief overview of how CORS works:

1. Browser Sends Preflight Request (Optional):** For certain types of requests 
(e.g., those with custom headers or non-standard methods), the browser may send 
a preflight request using the HTTP OPTIONS method to check with the server if the a
ctual request is allowed.

2. Server Responds with CORS Headers:** The server responds to the preflight r
equest or the actual request with appropriate CORS headers. These headers include
 information such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` (specifying which origins are
  allowed), `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` (listing the HTTP methods allowed), 
  and others.

3. Browser Enforces Access Control:** Based on the CORS headers received from the
 server, the browser determines whether to allow or block the cross-origin request. 
 If the server's CORS headers permit the request, the browser allows it. Otherwise,
  it blocks the request for security reasons.

To handle CORS-related issues in a web application, you can take the following steps:

1. Configure Server for CORS: Ensure that your server is configured to include the
 appropriate CORS headers in its responses. This involves setting headers such as 
 Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, and others.

2. Handle Preflight Requests: If your web application makes requests that trigger preflight 
checks (e.g., due to custom headers or non-standard methods), make sure your server handles 
the preflight OPTIONS requests correctly.

3. Use Credentials Wisely: If your requests involve credentials (such as cookies or HTTP authentication),
 ensure that the server is configured to allow credentials across origins (Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true).
  Also, be cautious when sharing credentials across origins.
